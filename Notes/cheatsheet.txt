Welcome to Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio!
Your admin has set-up a project for you to use. Access your project by signing in with the provided IAM role, then navigate to the specified URL.
URL: https://dzd-bvf5fry861dqsn.sagemaker.us-east-1.on.aws/overview
IAM role: arn:aws:iam::289248149480:role/IibsAdminAccess-DO-NOT-DELETE


Step 1: Verify Environment

Open a terminal in SageMaker Studio.

Check Python version:

python3 --version

Create a virtual environment (optional but clean):

python3 -m venv ai_env
source ai_env/bin/activate

Install libraries you’ll need in Weeks 0–12:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyterlab torch torchvision torchaudio transformers

Verify installations:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
import transformers
print("Environment ready!")



git add .
git commit -m "Update notebooks for Week X"
git push origin main

This also allows you to access your notebooks from any machine if needed.

2️⃣ Shutting Down Safely

Close the notebook tabs in Jupyter Lab.

Stop any running kernels (optional — frees resources but keeps your files).

You don’t have to stop the Studio app; your files remain in your SageMaker user space.

3️⃣ Reopening Later

Go to AWS SageMaker Studio
 → Launch Studio.

Select the same user profile you used before.

Open Jupyter Lab. Your home directory will have all your notebooks and folders intact.

Your cloned GitHub repo will still be there.

Any virtual environment you created (e.g., ai_env) may need to be reactivated:

source ai_env/bin/activate
4️⃣ Optional: Connecting GitHub Again

If you want to pull updates or push from a different machine:

# Pull latest changes
cd AI_Deep_Dive
git pull origin main

# Push new changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update Week X notebook"
git push origin main
